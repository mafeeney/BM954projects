Organising your project work, and managing your time effectively, may seem like very basic skills that require no guidance/help. However, both are fundamental and underpin not only your work in this project, but will likely be important for your work/career going forward. It is possible to improve your project and time management skills (and thus become a more effective worker) - but this takes attention and focus.

Remember, your project performance mark contributes to your overall mark for the BM954 module. This includes your ability to manage your project independently, meet deadlines, come prepared to meetings, etc.

This section is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to project and time management, but does provide a curated set of resources that may help you get started.

## Back up your work!!!

**Please** make sure you back up your thesis work. IT issues such as computer failure are **not** considered grounds for an extension (and you don't want to have to redo all your hard work anyway!) It is good practice to make sure you have at least three secure back-up copies of your work stored in different places.
