    "text": "This may be your first time working on a scientific project, and/or your first time producing a scientific document (thesis). These guidelines are here to give you an idea of what to expect, and should be read in conjunction with the BM954 guidance (available on the module MyPlace page.) Please read through these expectations and bring any questions or concerns that you would like to discuss with Dr. Feeney to our first meeting.\n\nScience:\n\nMaintain a lab notebook, either on paper or electronically. Human memory is fallible! Your notebook should be thorough and legible – if you come back to it in a month’s time, you should be able to reconstruct what you did.\n\nFor each experiment, please write the Objective, Background, Methods (including deviations from established methods), Results, and Conclusion (Your future self will thank you for doing this!)\n\nFiles should be saved with clear, concise file names and saved where you can find them again. Back up your work frequently and in more than one place – you do not want to lose all of your data!\nAt the end of the project, I expect you to provide me with the raw data files from your work: e.g. for a phylogenetic tree, I expect the .fasta file containing all of the sequences, the multiple sequence alignment of the sequences, and the .newick file for the tree. This is so that projects can be continued/expanded in future years.\n\n\n\nTeamwork/collegiality:\n\nScience is a team effort and it benefits from people working together in groups – we can accomplish more together than one person working alone can.\nListen respectfully to each other, learn from each other, and contribute as you can.\nBe respectful of others’ different life experiences, learn from them when appropriate, and contribute when appropriate. Do not insult or put down people who share their experiences. Harassment, sexism, racism, or exclusionary comments are not appropriate and prevent people from participating in science.\nRecognize that every person will bring strengths and weaknesses with them. Highlight each others strengths, and help each other overcome our weaknesses.\nIf you find that you have made a mistake: listen, offer a genuine apology, and commit to learning and doing better.\n\n\n\nKindness:\n\nBe kind to yourself. Be mindful of your limits, and aware of the fact that you are still in the middle of a global pandemic/distressing news cycles – give yourself credit for the hard work that you’re doing every day.\nBe kind to others. Give them the benefit of the doubt when needed; remember that online communication often misses nuance or meaning. Remember that everyone is struggling right now and may not be able to be their best selves.\nBe patient. Science can be hard work – things take longer to accomplish, particularly at first; you may need to repeat experiments or start over with a new dataset. This is all part of the process – you are making progress, even though it may not be readily apparent.\n\n\n\nCommunication:\n\nClear, open, honest communication – I cannot help if you don’t let me know that there’s a problem.\nMeetings at least once a week. The standard for meetings is that they are to be in person, on campus. In rare exceptions, meetings may be held via Zoom/Teams. [Online meeting etiquette: turning your camera, microphone on/off is completely up to you, no pressure either way.]\nBetween meetings, I’m available by e-mail to answer questions or you can schedule a drop-in Zoom (depending on our schedules).\nDon’t be afraid to ask for help:\n\nMe (…this is literally my job!)\nEach other\nThe micro group\nAsk questions in your lectures/open office sessions\nTwitter/BlueSky/etc. (you will often find interested experts in the field on social media, happy to chat about their favourite subject! Don’t be a bother/expect them to do your work for you, but do engage politely and respectfully.)\n\nHow to ask for help: … after Google, reading papers, looking at manuals and FAQs has proven unhelpful!\n\nBe detailed and specific! (“I tried it and it didn’t work” is not a useful question).\nExplain what you were trying to do, exactly how you tried to do it, exactly what happened (e.g. what error message you got) – include screenshots if they help to illustrate the problem. This will save a lot of time and back-and-forth e-mails\n\nTake ownership of your project: I am here to help and to guide you, but this is not my thesis (I have already done one!) Come prepared to meetings Think independently and critically Read broadly All of the above contributes to your project performance mark\nDon’t be afraid to tell me that I’m wrong:\n\nYour data may well contradict my hypotheses or ideas\nYou might find something in the literature that I wasn’t aware of\nYou may well have insights and clever thoughts that I won’t have\nDoing science is about being able to challenge the accepted dogma and prove ideas wrong\n\n\n\n\nWhat you can expect from me:\n\nKindness, team-work, and collegiality\nAdvice and guidance on planning and carrying out your experiments\nGuidance on how to write a scientific document\nFeedback on drafts and practice presentation\nGood communication\nE-mail responses within 24h (I will do my absolute best)\nFeedback on project performance\nReferences when you are applying for jobs/PhDs/etc. in the future (please do give me some advance notice of these, as it helps me to plan my work and make sure that the reference is submitted on time)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few tips and suggestions for success\n\n\n\n\nTake care of yourself (a healthy mind requires a healthy body)\nStay organized. Set yourself deadlines (but be flexible when need be)\nDon’t feel the need to write your draft in one go – it’s much better to work on it a little bit every day (marathon, not a sprint)\nBreak it down into small tasks\nGet into the habit of writing at least a few sentences daily\nTake breaks and let your mind rest/process ideas (take a walk, wash the dishes, drink some tea).\nTake breaks from the screen.\nWhen you read papers, and go to seminars/journal clubs: pay attention to the way that other people explain their science (what works? what doesn’t?)",

You will often get great ideas from reading papers outside your field, or be able to make connections to other systems/organisms/etc. (Plus, you’ll be able to use it as extra reading in your exams!)\nOrganise your references as you go along. Use reference management software\nWrite clearly and concisely\nPay attention to sentence and paragraph structure\nBe specific & say what you mean\nUse figures where appropriate\nProofread\nCite appropriate references using a correct style\nPay attention to the instructions and the assessment criteria (available on Myplace)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify key results (outline/bullet points)\nStart writing by first making your figures (the “backbone” of your story)\nWrite the methods section (make sure you cover every experiment presented in your figures/tables)\nWrite your results section, going through each of your results (figures) in a logical order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganize your thoughts logically\n\n\n\nFor each experiment, explain:\n\nyour aim (the reason why you did the experiment)\nthe method (how you did the experiment)\nthe results (what you found)\nthe significance (what the results mean)\n\n--always in that order!!\n\n\nWrite your discussion (what do your results mean?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting a Good Discussion Section\n\n\n\nCan you create a model figure illustrating your results and placing them in the context of what was previously known?\nMake sure that any information essential for understanding your results (context) was present in the introduction. In your discussion, have you gone back to address all the key points raised in your intro?\nMake sure you do not just reiterate/rehash the points raised in your results section. Instead, make sure you put your results in the broader context (what is known in the literature? How do your results relate to other systems/types of cells/situations/etc.?)\n\n\nProofread, edit, and improve your draft based on feedback.\nWrite an abstract and decide on a title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Common Scientific Writing Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\n\n\n\nProblem: Lack of attention to sentence structure\nExample: “Some students have really excellent ideas and are putting those ideas in their theses and making sure that they reference other people’s ideas from the literature correctly and using reference management software in appropriate ways and including a list of references at the end of their thesis. So great.”\nSolution: Be ruthless about editing your sentences until each sentence contains just one idea (the example above contained at least 4 separate ideas). It may help to read your writing aloud, as in the above example: take note of where you would naturally pause to take a breath.\nAt one end of the extreme, you have long, convoluted sentences that try to do too much (the first sentence in the example). At the other end, you have another type of grammatical disaster - beware sentence fragments.\n\nProblem: Use of scientific jargon and/or excessive acronyms\nExample: “We spun down the cells and washed them with PBS.”\nSolution: “spun down the cells” is something you might say colloquially (and that’s fine), However, in formal scientific language, you would say that the cells were centrifuged. Avoid colloquialisms and make sure you always define abbreviations (like PBS) at the first use.\n\nProblem: Lack of precision and/or attention to detail\nExample: “The genes in E. coli were translated and cheY was well conserved.”\nSolution: Pay careful attention to conventions in your field and precise usage of terms.

    "text": "Identify key results (outline/bullet points)\nStart writing by first making your figures (the “backbone” of your story)\nWrite the methods section (make sure you cover every experiment presented in your figures/tables)\nWrite your results section, going through each of your results (figures) in a logical order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganize your thoughts logically\n\n\n\nFor each experiment, explain:\n\nyour aim (the reason why you did the experiment)\nthe method (how you did the experiment)\nthe results (what you found)\nthe significance (what the results mean)\n\n--always in that order!!\n\n\nWrite your discussion (what do your results mean?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting a Good Discussion Section\n\n\n\nCan you create a model figure illustrating your results and placing them in the context of what was previously known?\nMake sure that any information essential for understanding your results (context) was present in the introduction. In your discussion, have you gone back to address all the key points raised in your intro?\nMake sure you do not just reiterate/rehash the points raised in your results section. Instead, make sure you put your results in the broader context (what is known in the literature? How do your results relate to other systems/types of cells/situations/etc.?)\n\n\nProofread, edit, and improve your draft based on feedback.\nWrite an abstract and decide on a title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Common Scientific Writing Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\n\n\n\nProblem: Lack of attention to sentence structure\nExample: “Some students have really excellent ideas and are putting those ideas in their theses and making sure that they reference other people’s ideas from the literature correctly and using reference management software in appropriate ways and including a list of references at the end of their thesis. So great.”\nSolution: Be ruthless about editing your sentences until each sentence contains just one idea (the example above contained at least 4 separate ideas). It may help to read your writing aloud, as in the above example: take note of where you would naturally pause to take a breath.\nAt one end of the extreme, you have long, convoluted sentences that try to do too much (the first sentence in the example). At the other end, you have another type of grammatical disaster - beware sentence fragments.\n\nProblem: Use of scientific jargon and/or excessive acronyms\nExample: “We spun down the cells and washed them with PBS.”\nSolution: “spun down the cells” is something you might say colloquially (and that’s fine), However, in formal scientific language, you would say that the cells were centrifuged. Avoid colloquialisms and make sure you always define abbreviations (like PBS) at the first use.\n\nProblem: Lack of precision and/or attention to detail\nExample: “The genes in E. coli were translated and cheY was well conserved.”\nSolution: Pay careful attention to conventions in your field and precise usage of terms. Ask a friend or colleague to look over your writing and make sure that it conveys your intended meaning.\nHere, gene and species names should be italicized by convention (N.B. cheY refers to the gene, CheY refers to the protein). “Translated” is mis-used (remember that genes are transcribed). Finally, the sentence is, overall, frustratingly vague (which genes? what does “well conserved” mean?).\nA better and more meaningful version: “The genes involved in chemotaxis in E. coli were expressed under these experimental conditions (mid-logarithmic phase in MOPS minimal medium at 37° C). cheY was well-conserved, with homologs found in 99.4% of all analysed E. coli genomes.)",

    "text": "Every project is different, and thus, the schedule for each project will be different. The general expectation within SIPBS is that these projects should be treated like full-time jobs (e.g., you should be working from 9-5 M-F on them); however, there may be some scope for flexibility in working times/schedules, depending on your project needs.\nYou are expected to plan and be responsible for your own time. Some weeks may be busier than others, in terms of experimental work - on quieter weeks, you can spend your time wisely by reading the literature, working on your draft, analysing data, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nKey to being able to successfully execute a project is the ability to plan ahead. You are strongly encouraged to come up with a draft schedule for your project in week 1, and to share/discuss this with Dr. Feeney (for feedback and suggestions on how to improve it.\nWhen planning your work, you should be particularly aware of the time that it takes to execute an experiment and analyse the data: e.g., if you are incubating cells, they will take time to grow; if you are using a survey, you will need time to process and analyse the data after it has been collected.\nYou may find it useful to use e.g., a Gantt Chart to plan your project, although this is not required.\n\n\nYou are expected to attend all meetings/group meetings. You should have completed any indicated activities for that meeting (listed in “What you should do to prepare”). You should also come prepared with any questions (e.g., about papers you have read, results from your experimental work, general questions about good scientific practices, etc.)\nNote that the resources provided (e.g., papers listed in the project descriptor, resources linked in this website) are only intended as a starting point. You are expected to search the literature independently (this is part of your project performance mark.) You are also strongly encouraged to seek out additional resources to support your learning and development as a researcher (e.g. time management apps/resources, ggplot2 tutorials, additional writing tips/guidance….)\nPlease be sure to check the BM954 MyPlace page regularly for any updates to official deadlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must agree on deadlines for the submission of drafts with Dr. Feeney in advance. When considering this, take into account the fact that you will need time to incorporate Dr. Feeney’s feedback before the final submission of your thesis.",

These may take different forms: e.g., a wet lab experiment might involve disrupting a gene to test its function; a science communication experiment might involve using a survey to assess whether a particular piece of science communication is effective or not; a bioinformatics experiment might involve using a multiple sequence alignment tool to test whether a particular amino acid residue in a protein is well-conserved amongst a set of homologous proteins.\nRegardless of the type of experiment, you will want to make sure that you are carrying it out to the best of your ability. You need, for example, to ensure that you are using the most appropriate technique and including any appropriate controls.\nGood experimental design requires critical thought. You are not expected to blindly do experiments “because Dr. Feeney said so” or “because so-and-so did it this way”.

Do you have an appropriate positive control and negative control (if appropriate for this type of experiment)?\nWill you be able to correctly interpret the results of your experiment, or might you be misled by false positives/false negatives/other errors?\nMake sure you have a clear hypothesis/aim, and that your experiment is actually able to test that hypothesis/achieve that aim.\nChange one thing at a time. Don’t overcomplicate things, or try to do too much at once - simpler is generally better.\nHave a plan for data analysis and statistical analysis before you begin - this should not be an afterthought.\n\n\n\nThe other pages in this section contain various resources for the different types of experiments you might be carrying out as part of your project (e.g., bioinformatics, science communication, etc.) - but as always, this is not meant to be taken as an exhaustive list. You are advised to read broadly, think deeply about your experiments, and discuss your experimental design in detail with Dr. Feeney.\nSuggested reading about experimental design:",
