    "text": "Please go through the Thesis submission checklist and ensure that your thesis meets all the guidelines before submitting it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan’s Top Tips for Writing a Great Thesis, Starting from Day One\n\n\n\n\nRead broadly & think critically. You will often get great ideas from reading papers outside your field, or be able to make connections to other systems/organisms/etc. (Plus, you’ll be able to use it as extra reading in your exams!)\nOrganise your references as you go along. Use reference management software\nWrite clearly and concisely\nPay attention to sentence and paragraph structure\nBe specific & say what you mean\nUse figures where appropriate\nProofread\nCite appropriate references using a correct style\nPay attention to the instructions and the assessment criteria (available on Myplace)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify key results (outline/bullet points)\nStart writing by first making your figures (the “backbone” of your story)\nWrite the methods section (make sure you cover every experiment presented in your figures/tables)\nWrite your results section, going through each of your results (figures) in a logical order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganize your thoughts logically\n\n\n\nFor each experiment, explain:\n\nyour aim (the reason why you did the experiment)\nthe method (how you did the experiment)\nthe results (what you found)\nthe significance (what the results mean)\n\n--always in that order!!\n\n\nWrite your discussion (what do your results mean?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting a Good Discussion Section\n\n\n\nCan you create a model figure illustrating your results and placing them in the context of what was previously known?\nMake sure that any information essential for understanding your results (context) was present in the introduction. In your discussion, have you gone back to address all the key points raised in your intro?\nMake sure you do not just reiterate/rehash the points raised in your results section. Instead, make sure you put your results in the broader context (what is known in the literature? How do your results relate to other systems/types of cells/situations/etc.?)\n\n\nProofread, edit, and improve your draft based on feedback.\nWrite an abstract and decide on a title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Common Scientific Writing Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\n\n\n\nProblem: Lack of attention to sentence structure\nExample: “Some students have really excellent ideas and are putting those ideas in their theses and making sure that they reference other people’s ideas from the literature correctly and using reference management software in appropriate ways and including a list of references at the end of their thesis. So great.”\nSolution: Be ruthless about editing your sentences until each sentence contains just one idea (the example above contained at least 4 separate ideas). It may help to read your writing aloud, as in the above example: take note of where you would naturally pause to take a breath.\nAt one end of the extreme, you have long, convoluted sentences that try to do too much (the first sentence in the example). At the other end, you have another type of grammatical disaster - beware sentence fragments.\n\nProblem: Use of scientific jargon and/or excessive acronyms\nExample: “We spun down the cells and washed them with PBS.”\nSolution: “spun down the cells” is something you might say colloquially (and that’s fine), However, in formal scientific language, you would say that the cells were centrifuged. Avoid colloquialisms and make sure you always define abbreviations (like PBS) at the first use.\n\nProblem: Lack of precision and/or attention to detail\nExample: “The genes in E. coli were translated and cheY was well conserved.”\nSolution: Pay careful attention to conventions in your field and precise usage of terms. Ask a friend or colleague to look over your writing and make sure that it conveys your intended meaning.\nHere, gene and species names should be italicized by convention (N.B. cheY refers to the gene, CheY refers to the protein). “Translated” is mis-used (remember that genes are transcribed). Finally, the sentence is, overall, frustratingly vague (which genes? what does “well conserved” mean?).\nA better and more meaningful version: “The genes involved in chemotaxis in E. coli were expressed under these experimental conditions (mid-logarithmic phase in MOPS minimal medium at 37° C). cheY was well-conserved, with homologs found in 99.4% of all analysed E. coli genomes.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a style guide, e.g. The Elements of Style\nHow to write a first-class paper\nTen simple rules for scientists: Improving your writing productivity\nNovelist Cormac McCarthy’s tips on how to write a great science pape\nTen simple rules for structuring papers\nImproving your scientific writing: a short guide\nSome tips for scientific writing\nTen Simple (Empirical) Rules for Writing Science\nSIMPLIFY Science Writing",

    "section": "",
    "text": "This may be your first time working on a scientific project, and/or your first time producing a scientific document (thesis). These guidelines are here to give you an idea of what to expect, and should be read in conjunction with the BM432 learning agreement (available on the module MyPlace page.) Please read through these expectations and bring any questions or concerns that you would like to discuss with Dr. Feeney to our first meeting.\n\nScience:\n\nMaintain a lab notebook, either on paper or electronically. Human memory is fallible! Your notebook should be thorough and legible – if you come back to it in a month’s time, you should be able to reconstruct what you did.\n\nFor each experiment, please write: Objective Background Methods, including deviations from established methods Results Conclusion\n\nFiles should be saved with clear, concise file names and saved where you can find them again. Back up your work frequently and in more than one place – you do not want to lose all of your data!\nAt the end of the project, I expect you to provide me with the raw data files from your work: e.g. for a phylogenetic tree, I expect the .fasta file containing all of the sequences, the multiple sequence alignment of the sequences, and the .newick file for the tree. This is so that projects can be continued/expanded in future years.\n\n\n\nTeamwork/collegiality:\n\nScience is a team effort and it benefits from people working together in groups – we can accomplish more together than one person working alone can.\nListen respectfully to each other, learn from each other, and contribute as you can.\nBe respectful of others’ different life experiences, learn from them when appropriate, and contribute when appropriate. Do not insult or put down people who share their experiences. Harassment, sexism, racism, or exclusionary comments are not appropriate and prevent people from participating in science.\nRecognize that every person will bring strengths and weaknesses with them. Highlight each others strengths, and help each other overcome our weaknesses.\nIf you find that you have made a mistake: listen, offer a genuine apology, and commit to learning and doing better.\n\n\n\nKindness:\n\nBe kind to yourself. Be mindful of your limits, and aware of the fact that you are still in the middle of a global pandemic – give yourself credit for the hard work that you’re doing every day.\nBe kind to others. Give them the benefit of the doubt when needed; remember that online communication often misses nuance or meaning. Remember that everyone is struggling right now and may not be able to be their best selves.\nBe patient. Science can be hard work – things take longer to accomplish, particularly at first; you may need to repeat experiments or start over with a new dataset. This is all part of the process – you are making progress, even though it may not be readily apparent.\n\n\n\nCommunication:\n\nClear, open, honest communication – I cannot help if you don’t let me know that there’s a problem.\nMeetings at least once a week in person or via Zoom (individual and/or group meetings). Zoom etiquette: turning your camera, microphone on/off is completely up to you, no pressure either way.\nBetween meetings, I’m available by e-mail to answer questions or you can schedule a drop-in Zoom (depending on our schedules).\nDon’t be afraid to ask for help:\n\nMe (…this is literally my job!)\nEach other\nThe micro group\nAsk questions in your lectures/open office sessions\nTwitter (a great place to crowdsource science questions)\n\nHow to ask for help: … after Google, reading papers, looking at manuals and FAQs has proven unhelpful!\n\nBe detailed and specific! (“I tried it and it didn’t work” is not a useful question).\nExplain what you were trying to do, exactly how you tried to do it, exactly what happened (e.g. what error message you got) – include screenshots if they help to illustrate the problem. This will save a lot of time and back-and-forth e-mails\n\nTake ownership of your project: I am here to help and to guide you, but this is not my thesis (I have already done one!) Come prepared to meetings Think independently and critically Read broadly All of the above contributes to your project performance mark\nDon’t be afraid to tell me that I’m wrong:\n\nYour data may well contradict my hypotheses or ideas\nYou might find something in the literature that I wasn’t aware of\nYou may well have insights and clever thoughts that I won’t have\nDoing science is about being able to challenge the accepted dogma and prove ideas wrong\n\n\n\n\nWhat you can expect from me:\n\nKindness, team-work, and collegiality\nAdvice and guidance on planning and carrying out your experiments\nGuidance on how to write a scientific document\nFeedback on drafts and practice presentation\nGood communication\nE-mail responses within 24h (I will do my absolute best)\nFeedback on project performance\nReferences (no need to ask for permission, but I do appreciate as much notice as possible)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few tips and suggestions for success\n\n\n\n\nTake care of yourself (a healthy mind requires a healthy body)\nStay organized Set yourself deadlines (but be flexible when need be)\nDon’t feel the need to write your draft in one go – it’s much better to work on it a little bit every day (marathon, not a sprint)\nBreak it down into small tasks\nGet into the habit of writing at least a few sentences daily\nTake breaks and let your mind rest/process ideas (take a walk, wash the dishes, drink some tea).\nTake breaks from the screen.\nWhen you read papers, and go to seminars/journal clubs: pay attention to the way that other people explain their science (what works? what doesn’t?)",

    "text": "A great deal of academic writing is, to put it quite simply, very bad. It may be unnecessarily verbose, confusing, or unclear. Or, it may be written with no reference to the reader’s likely background knowledge or experience, leaving ideas that are quite clear in the writer’s mind inaccessible for most readers. Worst of all, it may indeed sometimes be written in a deliberately deceptive way - as Calvin says, inflating weak ideas and obscuring poor reasoning (Figure 1). All of these writing “sins” should be avoided.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting well is a skill that all scientists must develop with practice and through incorporating feedback from readers into their writing practice. Just as you would not expect to win a marathon or paint a masterpiece on the first attempt, you cannot expect your writing to be flawless when you first begin. Constant practice is essential.\nWe will therefore give you the opportunity to practice your writing skills in the following set of exercises during your final year project. You do not need to read through the exercises or complete them in advance of our group meetings; however, the slides/documents for each exercise are provided below for your reference.\nThe “Principles of Composition” exercises are largely based on Strunk & White’s The Elements of Style, which is an excellent resource (available online or at your friendly university library). In addition to the principles of composition we will be discussing, Strunk & White contains sections on grammar and spelling, which may be helpful. However, there are many other style guides and writing resources available which you may wish to consult (see (add link here) for an inexhaustive list).\nIn addition to the weekly writing exercises we will work through in our group meetings, I have provided a set of exercises that aim to help you with various other aspects of scientific writing (add link here). You are encouraged to work through these in your own time.\nFinally, please note that writing well and easily is a matter of constant practice (Figure 2). Try to make an effort to write a little every day; and whenever you write, evaluate your own writing, and seek out feedback on ways that you can improve. These are skills that you will find useful not just for writing your honours thesis, but throughout your studies and in your future career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting exercise 01: Evaluating Scientific Writing\nWriting exercise 02: Paragraph Structure; using topic sentences and organizing the logical flow of information in a paragraph\nWriting exercise 03: Use definite, specific, concrete language; Put statements in positive form\nWriting exercise 04: Omit needless words; tips for succinct, concise writing\nWriting exercise 05: Active vs. passive voice and choice of verb tenses\nWriting exercise 06: Use of transition words/phrases\nWriting exercise 07: Sentence structure considerations (use parallel construction, keep related words together, place emphasis at the end of sentences)\nWriting exercise 08: Avoiding jargon, acronyms, and abbreviations\nWriting exercise 09: Word choice considerations\nWriting exercise 10: Experimental narratives (how to describe an experiment)\nWriting exercise 11: Editing\n\n\n\nYou are encouraged to work through the following exercises independently, but please don’t hesitate to discuss them with Dr. Feeney if you have any questions.\n\nAdditional exercise 01: Paragraph structure\nAdditional exercise 02: Sentence structure/form (more practice with some of Strunk & White’s Principles of Composition)\nAdditional exercise 03: Hypotheses — Additional exercise 03 with Brucella hypothesis examples discussed in our meeting\nAdditional exercise 04: Structuring your introduction\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best ways to improve your writing is to read broadly and pay attention to the way that papers are written. Take note of which writing techniques are effective and which are less so, and then apply these ideas to your own writing.",
