    "text": "This may be your first time working on a scientific project, and/or your first time producing a scientific document (thesis). These guidelines are here to give you an idea of what to expect, and should be read in conjunction with the BM954 guidance (available on the module MyPlace page.) Please read through these expectations and bring any questions or concerns that you would like to discuss with Dr. Feeney to our first meeting.\n\nScience:\n\nMaintain a lab notebook, either on paper or electronically. Human memory is fallible! Your notebook should be thorough and legible – if you come back to it in a month’s time, you should be able to reconstruct what you did.\n\nFor each experiment, please write the Objective, Background, Methods (including deviations from established methods), Results, and Conclusion (Your future self will thank you for doing this!)\n\nFiles should be saved with clear, concise file names and saved where you can find them again. Back up your work frequently and in more than one place – you do not want to lose all of your data!\nAt the end of the project, I expect you to provide me with the raw data files from your work: e.g. for a phylogenetic tree, I expect the .fasta file containing all of the sequences, the multiple sequence alignment of the sequences, and the .newick file for the tree. This is so that projects can be continued/expanded in future years.\n\n\n\nTeamwork/collegiality:\n\nScience is a team effort and it benefits from people working together in groups – we can accomplish more together than one person working alone can.\nListen respectfully to each other, learn from each other, and contribute as you can.\nBe respectful of others’ different life experiences, learn from them when appropriate, and contribute when appropriate. Do not insult or put down people who share their experiences. Harassment, sexism, racism, or exclusionary comments are not appropriate and prevent people from participating in science.\nRecognize that every person will bring strengths and weaknesses with them. Highlight each others strengths, and help each other overcome our weaknesses.\nIf you find that you have made a mistake: listen, offer a genuine apology, and commit to learning and doing better.\n\n\n\nKindness:\n\nBe kind to yourself. Be mindful of your limits, and aware of the fact that you are still in the middle of a global pandemic/distressing news cycles – give yourself credit for the hard work that you’re doing every day.\nBe kind to others. Give them the benefit of the doubt when needed; remember that online communication often misses nuance or meaning. Remember that everyone is struggling right now and may not be able to be their best selves.\nBe patient. Science can be hard work – things take longer to accomplish, particularly at first; you may need to repeat experiments or start over with a new dataset. This is all part of the process – you are making progress, even though it may not be readily apparent.\n\n\n\nCommunication:\n\nClear, open, honest communication – I cannot help if you don’t let me know that there’s a problem.\nMeetings at least once a week. The standard for meetings is that they are to be in person, on campus. In rare exceptions, meetings may be held via Zoom/Teams. [Online meeting etiquette: turning your camera, microphone on/off is completely up to you, no pressure either way.]\nBetween meetings, I’m available by e-mail to answer questions or you can schedule a drop-in Zoom (depending on our schedules).\nDon’t be afraid to ask for help:\n\nMe (…this is literally my job!)\nEach other\nThe micro group\nAsk questions in your lectures/open office sessions\nTwitter/BlueSky/etc. (you will often find interested experts in the field on social media, happy to chat about their favourite subject! Don’t be a bother/expect them to do your work for you, but do engage politely and respectfully.)\n\nHow to ask for help: … after Google, reading papers, looking at manuals and FAQs has proven unhelpful!\n\nBe detailed and specific! (“I tried it and it didn’t work” is not a useful question).\nExplain what you were trying to do, exactly how you tried to do it, exactly what happened (e.g. what error message you got) – include screenshots if they help to illustrate the problem. This will save a lot of time and back-and-forth e-mails\n\nTake ownership of your project: I am here to help and to guide you, but this is not my thesis (I have already done one!) Come prepared to meetings Think independently and critically Read broadly All of the above contributes to your project performance mark\nDon’t be afraid to tell me that I’m wrong:\n\nYour data may well contradict my hypotheses or ideas\nYou might find something in the literature that I wasn’t aware of\nYou may well have insights and clever thoughts that I won’t have\nDoing science is about being able to challenge the accepted dogma and prove ideas wrong\n\n\n\n\nWhat you can expect from me:\n\nKindness, team-work, and collegiality\nAdvice and guidance on planning and carrying out your experiments\nGuidance on how to write a scientific document\nFeedback on drafts and practice presentation\nGood communication\nE-mail responses within 24h (I will do my absolute best)\nFeedback on project performance\nReferences when you are applying for jobs/PhDs/etc. in the future (please do give me some advance notice of these, as it helps me to plan my work and make sure that the reference is submitted on time)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few tips and suggestions for success\n\n\n\n\nTake care of yourself (a healthy mind requires a healthy body)\nStay organized. Set yourself deadlines (but be flexible when need be)\nDon’t feel the need to write your draft in one go – it’s much better to work on it a little bit every day (marathon, not a sprint)\nBreak it down into small tasks\nGet into the habit of writing at least a few sentences daily\nTake breaks and let your mind rest/process ideas (take a walk, wash the dishes, drink some tea).\nTake breaks from the screen.\nWhen you read papers, and go to seminars/journal clubs: pay attention to the way that other people explain their science (what works? what doesn’t?)",

    "text": "During the course of your thesis work, you will likely be carrying out a number of different experiments. These may take different forms: e.g., a wet lab experiment might involve disrupting a gene to test its function; a science communication experiment might involve using a survey to assess whether a particular piece of science communication is effective or not; a bioinformatics experiment might involve using a multiple sequence alignment tool to test whether a particular amino acid residue in a protein is well-conserved amongst a set of homologous proteins.\nRegardless of the type of experiment, you will want to make sure that you are carrying it out to the best of your ability. You need, for example, to ensure that you are using the most appropriate technique and including any appropriate controls.\nGood experimental design requires critical thought. You are not expected to blindly do experiments “because Dr. Feeney said so” or “because so-and-so did it this way”. Instead, you should make certain that you are thinking about your experiments and making the best and most appropriate choices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan’s top tips for good experimental design\n\n\n\n\nControls, controls, controls. Do you have an appropriate positive control and negative control (if appropriate for this type of experiment)?\nWill you be able to correctly interpret the results of your experiment, or might you be misled by false positives/false negatives/other errors?\nMake sure you have a clear hypothesis/aim, and that your experiment is actually able to test that hypothesis/achieve that aim.\nChange one thing at a time. Don’t overcomplicate things, or try to do too much at once - simpler is generally better.\nHave a plan for data analysis and statistical analysis before you begin - this should not be an afterthought.\n\n\n\nThe other pages in this section contain various resources for the different types of experiments you might be carrying out as part of your project (e.g., bioinformatics, science communication, etc.) - but as always, this is not meant to be taken as an exhaustive list.

    "text": "A great deal of academic writing is, to put it quite simply, very bad. It may be unnecessarily verbose, confusing, or unclear. Or, it may be written with no reference to the reader’s likely background knowledge or experience, leaving ideas that are quite clear in the writer’s mind inaccessible for most readers. Worst of all, it may indeed sometimes be written in a deliberately deceptive way - as Calvin says, inflating weak ideas and obscuring poor reasoning (Figure 1). All of these writing “sins” should be avoided.\n\n\n\n‘Figure 1. Scientific writing. Image credit: Calvin and Hobbes, Bill Watterson.’\n\n\nWriting well is a skill that all scientists must develop with practice and through incorporating feedback from readers into their writing practice. Just as you would not expect to win a marathon or paint a masterpiece on the first attempt, you cannot expect your writing to be flawless when you first begin. Constant practice is essential.\n\n\n\nThere are two sets of writing exercises:\n\ncomposition exercises1 intended to assist with basic composition (sentence and paragraph structure, word choice, etc.)\nstructural exercises intended to help you understand how to structure the different elements of your thesis, and how to follow the scientific conventions for each.\n\nYou are expected to complete these exercises in your own time, but encouraged to discuss any of them with Dr. Feeney during your weekly meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou may complete these exercises at any time and in any order2, but you are expected to have completed all of the composition exercises before submitting an initial draft to Dr. Feeney.\n\n\nFinally, please note that writing well and easily is a matter of constant practice (Figure 2). Try to make an effort to write a little every day; and whenever you write, evaluate your own writing, and seek out feedback on ways that you can improve.

    "text": "A great deal of academic writing is, to put it quite simply, very bad. It may be unnecessarily verbose, confusing, or unclear. Or, it may be written with no reference to the reader’s likely background knowledge or experience, leaving ideas that are quite clear in the writer’s mind inaccessible for most readers. Worst of all, it may indeed sometimes be written in a deliberately deceptive way - as Calvin says, inflating weak ideas and obscuring poor reasoning (Figure 1). All of these writing “sins” should be avoided.\n\n\n\n‘Figure 1. Scientific writing.

You are strongly encouraged to come up with a draft schedule for your project in week 1, and to share/discuss this with Dr. Feeney (for feedback and suggestions on how to improve it.\nWhen planning your work, you should be particularly aware of the time that it takes to execute an experiment and analyse the data: e.g., if you are incubating cells, they will take time to grow; if you are using a survey, you will need time to process and analyse the data after it has been collected.\nYou may find it useful to use e.g., a Gantt Chart to plan your project, although this is not required.\n\n\nYou are expected to attend all meetings/group meetings. You should have completed any indicated activities for that meeting (as communicated in the previous meeting or by e-mail). You should also come prepared with any questions (e.g., about papers you have read, results from your experimental work, general questions about good scientific practices, etc.)\nNote that the resources provided (e.g., papers listed in the project descriptor, resources linked in this website) are only intended as a starting point. You are expected to search the literature independently (this is part of your project performance mark.) You are also strongly encouraged to seek out additional resources to support your learning and development as a researcher (e.g. time management apps/resources, ggplot2 tutorials, additional writing tips/guidance….)\nPlease be sure to check the BM954 MyPlace page regularly for any updates to official deadlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must agree on deadlines for the submission of drafts with Dr. Feeney in advance. When considering this, take into account the fact that it takes time to read a draft and provide feedback (indicative time: department policy is normally 2 weeks; and that you will also need time to incorporate Dr. Feeney’s feedback before the final submission of your thesis.",

    "text": "Literature review tips\nTip #1: From day 1, start using a reference manager to keep track of the papers you read. Use a sensible system to organize your notes. (There’s nothing like sitting down to write, and thinking - “I know I’ve read this somewhere - now where was it?” and then needing to spend five hours combing through the literature to find a paper you’ve already read.)\nTip #2: In general, make sure your space and workflow suit the type of work that you are doing. Depending on how you work best, you may find it helpful to remove all noise and distractions (or you may find it helpful to have some sort of background noise.) But in general, engaging with the scientific literature is easiest if you remove distractions and ensure that your workspace suits what you are doing (no Facebook notifications popping up to distract you; suitable materials for taking notes at hand and easily accessible; a comfortable workplace that helps you think well; etc.)\nTip #3: Be sure you have a sensible, and coherent, search strategy. Use search terms that make sense for your project, and refer to e.g., the PubMed User Guide or similar help documents if you need help understanding how to optimize your search strategies.\nTip #4: Read broadly, and think critically about what you read. Try to put papers in context with one another and build up a mental model of what is known in the field, including where there might be any contradictions (Remember: just because it’s been published doesn’t mean it’s true!) and where the gaps (interesting/unanswered questions and areas for future research) may be.\nTip #5: Read really broadly - many scientific discoveries have occurred because scientists were working across disciplines, or reading and learning about topics unrelated to their own particular research question. By being open to a wide range of papers, you will learn about methods and discoveries that may well have some application to your own work. (This will also come in handy when it comes to writing your discussion section - the best discussions “zoom” out and put the study’s findings in a broader context.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to ask yourself when completing your literature review\n\n\n\n\nHave I surveyed all of the relevant literature on this topic - including articles that might disagree with/contradict my hypothesis or ideas?\nAre there any relevant insights or comparisons I can add, by referring to literature on another topic/from another field?\nAm I giving the reader the background necessary for them to understand my research question and how I am addressing a gap in the literature?",
